Version Control
	Version control is a system that records changes to files over time.

It lets you track history, revert to earlier
 versions, and collaborate with others without overwriting each other’s work.

Think of it like a “time machine” for your
 code or documents.

Git

	Git is a version control tool.

It runs locally on your computer and keeps track of changes in your project.

Key 
features:


Commits: snapshots of your project at a point in time.


Branches: separate lines of development (like parallel 
universes for your code).


Merging: combining changes from different branches.

GitHub

GitHub is a cloud platform that hosts Git repositories online.

It adds collaboration features on top of Git:


Share your code with others.

Work together using pull requests and issues.

Store projects safely in the cloud.


In short: Git = the tool, GitHub = the place to share and collaborate using Git.
